## Data flow and transformation

- Parse: turn raw input (JSON, HTML, query strings, logs) into a structured representation (objects, ASTs).
- Map / Transform: convert data from one shape to another (DTOs, view models, domain models).
- Serialize / Deserialize: turn objects into bytes/strings (JSON, XML) and back.
- Validate / Sanitize: check data against rules and clean or reject unsafe input.
- Encode / Decode: change representation (URL‑encode, base64, JWT, character sets).

## Requests, persistence, and messaging

- Query: read/filter data from a DB or search engine.
- Fetch / Request: retrieve data over HTTP or other protocols.
- Create / Read / Update / Delete (CRUD): standard verbs for resource lifecycle in storage and APIs.
- Persist / Store / Cache: write and keep data in databases, caches, or files.
- Publish / Subscribe / Enqueue / Dispatch: send messages/events to queues, brokers, or handlers.

## Code, build, and runtime

- Compile / Transpile: turn source into another form (TS→JS, JSX→JS, minification, bundling).
- Bundle / Minify / Optimize: prepare assets for efficient delivery.
- Execute / Invoke / Call: run a function, handler, or script.
- Hook / Intercept: attach logic to a lifecycle event or pipeline (middleware, interceptors).
- Instrument / Profile / Monitor: add metrics, traces, or logs and analyze performance/behavior.

## UI, UX, and client behavior

- Render: turn state into UI (HTML, DOM, components, canvas).
- Mount / Unmount: attach or detach components from the DOM.
- Hydrate: attach client behavior to server‑rendered markup.
- Animate / Transition: change UI state with visual effects.
- Handle / Dispatch (events): process user or system events (clicks, input, navigation).

## Security, access, and control

- Authenticate / Authorize: verify identity and check permissions.
- Encrypt / Decrypt / Sign / Verify: protect or validate data and tokens.
- Hash: derive fixed‑length digests for passwords, cache keys, or integrity checks.
- Throttle / Rate‑Limit: control frequency of client actions.
- Escape / Filter: prevent injection and XSS by neutralizing unsafe content.
